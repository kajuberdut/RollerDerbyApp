<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

"Block Party" is a roller derby communication application. This application allows users to create a profile and update profile information with relevant derby information. 

After an account is created, a user is able to access all mixers and bouts by date or location. They are also able to create mixers and bouts and join the associated chats for those games.

The user is also able to create a team which automatically creates a chat. If the user creates a team the user becomes the administrator for that team. If the user creates a team, the user can then invite other players to the team. After players accepts invites, the user can create a download an excel document with the team information. This will streamline information for events or tournaments. Users also can chat with other users. 

This web application is built with Python, Flask, and FastApi. 

This application is functional and ready to use. However, there are more features that I would like to continue integrating. I hope to make this the main platform for roller derby players. 

## Features 
* Intuitive
* Easy to use
* Create an account
* Update profile
* Create Mixers and Bouts
* Create or join a team
* Download an excel document with team participant information
* Message other users 
* Join a mixer or bout chat
